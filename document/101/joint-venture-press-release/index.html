<p>The joint venture has appointed Studio Egret West as leading architects to realise its vision to give a new lease of life to one of East London&rsquo;s most iconic architectural buildings and its surrounding public space. Ab Rogers Design has been appointed to work with Studio Egret West on the interior design. This team will be important guardians to preserve the historic architecture and future of the building as a continued part of London&rsquo;s heritage and legacy and is dedicated to regenerating Balfron Tower&rsquo;s 146 apartments in a manner that is in keeping with Goldfinger&rsquo;s original vision for the space. Richard Coleman Citydesigner has been appointed as Heritage Consultant for the project.</p>

<p>Robert Soning, Chief Operating Officer, Londonewcastle, said: &ldquo;Balfron Tower is an inspirational building with an incredible heritage. We look forward to working with Poplar HARCA and United House Developments as guardians of this important building to breathe new life into it, and help realise the vision that Erno Goldfinger had for it over half a century ago.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Neal Hunt, Director of Development, Poplar HARCA, said: &ldquo;Londonewcastle and United House Developments were chosen by our regeneration panel of residents and development professionals for their vision for Balfron Tower and the immediate area. &nbsp; Our joint venture partnership will completely reinvigorate Balfron Tower and enable millions of pounds to be invested back into our community and the wider Poplar area. &nbsp;It is an incredibly exciting regeneration project which will impact on this area of east London for generations to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rick de Blaby, Chief Executive, United House Developments, said: &ldquo;Erno Goldfinger&rsquo;s Balfron Tower indelibly changed the landscape of our urban skyline and the thinking behind housing in post-war Britain, providing homes which combined the highest design standards with a unique view of the capital. Balfron Tower is a modernist national treasure and our stewardship of this important restoration &nbsp;will safeguard it for the future &ndash; and serve a catalyst to revitalise the local community.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
