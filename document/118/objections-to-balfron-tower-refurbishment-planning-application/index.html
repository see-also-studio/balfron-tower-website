          <p><strong>David Roberts, Draft report in objection to proposal PA/15/02554 (October 2015)</strong></p>

<p>Summary of key points</p>

<p>The application should be refused on four grounds based on relevant policy, guidance and precedent:</p>

<ol>
	<li><u>Failure to meet statutory affordable housing targets.&nbsp;</u>The application contains no statement on the future tenure of Balfron Tower&rsquo;s 146 flats. This omission indicates full privatisation and a resultant loss of 99 homes on social rent. This is in breach of two policies in the Mayor of London&rsquo;s The London Plan addressing &lsquo;existing housing&rsquo; and &lsquo;areas for regeneration&rsquo; which specifically state plans &lsquo;should resist loss of housing, including affordable housing&rsquo;. Furthermore, the failure to account for affordable housing is in contradiction to policy followed by precedent planning applications addressing the refurbishment of listed post-war public housing buildings in Tower Hamlets - Carradale House and Keeling House.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><u>Failure to meet best practice guidelines on inclusive consultation.&nbsp;</u>Consultation on the building&rsquo;s design and refurbishment works have been entirely hidden from residents, the local community and public scrutiny. The planning application identifies Balfron as a &lsquo;sensitive site&rsquo; which, according to Tower Hamlets&rsquo; Statement of Community Involvement, requires &lsquo;a range of additional consultation techniques&rsquo;. These have not taken place.</li>
	<li><u>Failure to meet adopted standards defining heritage significance.&nbsp;</u>It is wrong to submit this planning application for approval before Historic England have completed their ongoing investigation into upgrading Balfron Tower&rsquo;s listing to Grade II*. Furthermore, the planning application recognises Balfron&rsquo;s original purpose as social housing as &lsquo;significant in historic and architectural terms&rsquo;. Privatisation of all the tower&rsquo;s homes will destroy this heritage significance. Historic England&rsquo;s Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment states &lsquo;The use and appropriate management of a place for its original purpose&hellip; illustrates the relationship between design and function, and so may make a major contribution to its historical values. If so, cessation of that activity will diminish those values, and in the case of some specialised landscapes and buildings, may essentially destroy them&rsquo;.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><u>Failure to meet best practice guidelines on accountable regeneration.&nbsp;</u>Regeneration consultation documents promised &lsquo;no resident will lose their home involuntarily&rsquo; and &lsquo;there will be no loss of homes for rent on the Brownfield Estate&rsquo;. These obligations have not been fulfilled. This lack of honesty and clarity is in breach of Poplar HARCA&rsquo;s best practice guidelines articulated in their Social Housing Estate Regeneration Consultation Response, which advises &lsquo;being honest from the outset and presenting residents with the facts in simple, unjargonistic language&rsquo;. Furthermore, the planning application was lodged two days before the transfer of United House Group Holdings&rsquo;s stake in this regeneration development to Telford Homes. Their bearing could influence the plans by means unforeseen and unaccounted in the application.</li>
</ol>

<p>The development partners repeat their aim for this refurbishment to be an &lsquo;exemplar&rsquo; eighteen times in the planning application. However, rather than an exemplar, the proposals as they stand exemplify contemporary developments that segregate local communities and exemplify a unethical dispossession of social housing in London that constitutes a major contributing factor to the city&rsquo;s current and much publicised housing crisis.</p>

<p>It is not too late for the the development partners to reconsider their approach and deliver a truly exemplar project. This could set the benchmark for estate regeneration and refurbishment schemes by addressing:</p>

<ol>
	<li><u>Affordable housing</u> &ndash; retaining a proportion of social housing, genuinely affordable to local communities, in a flagship project.</li>
	<li><u>Inclusive consultation</u> &ndash; developing proposals together with current and former residents and the local estate community in which everyone is able to fully participate.</li>
	<li><u>Informed heritage</u> &ndash; identifying and conserving shared historical and communal values.</li>
	<li><u>Accountable regeneration</u> &ndash; opening full access to information in order to justify decisions and provide compelling evidence that every reasonable effort has been taken to minimise adverse impacts.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
