          <p><strong>p.92 Preliminary study for flat layout, Rowlett Street housing, Poplar, London, for the Greater London Council, 1962</strong><br />
Goldfinger was finally given the opportunity to realise his ideas on high building in a development for the Greater London Council. This study for flat layouts gives a good insight into his working methods showing his use in this instance for a 16-foot 6-inch grid, six times his standard grid of 2 feet 9 inches. &lsquo;Architecture&rsquo;, wrote Goldfinger, &lsquo;is the marriage of the scale of man to the scale of a building.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>p.93 Working drawing of sill details, Rowlett Street housing, Poplar, London, for the Greater London Council, 1966</strong><br />
Goldfinger&rsquo;s designs were always well worked out down to the smallest details and the block, unlike many other high-rise examples, was built to very high technical standards - standards which with the experience gained here were improved at Edenham Street.</p>

<p><strong>p.94 Design for Rowlett Street housing, Poplar, London, for the Greater London Council, 1966</strong><br />
Rowlett Street was built in three phases between 1964 and 1972 and its centrepiece was the 27-storey Balfron Tower, one of the tallest blocks in Europe. As with the Abbots Langley scheme a separate service tower housed the lifts and other noisy machinery well away from the residents and was linked to the main block by a series of access galleries. This concrete tower with its slit windows conjured up a fortress-like air which many found intimidating. Goldfinger&rsquo;s decision to live on the top floor for three months to rest how his design worked in practice ensured widespread press coverage but aroused suspicion that what to some seemed a brave sociological experiment was little more than a cheap publicity stunt. Even by the end of his first week&rsquo;s residence Goldfinger felt able to declare himself well satisfied, asserting that &lsquo;tall blocks with open space were the ideal of the moment. I have wanted to build this for 30 years&hellip; It will help bring the countryside to London.&rsquo; The &lsquo;thirty years&rsquo; comment was a reference to his CIAM housing project of 1933, many of the ideas for which Balfron Tower incorporated.</p>
