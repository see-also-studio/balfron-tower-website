          <p><em>In Danny Boyle&rsquo;s harrowing sci-fi horror 28 Days Later, we view a deserted London through the haunting and gritty lens of digital video cameras giving the immediacy of a documentary. Jim and Selina wander abandoned streets, survivors of a virus that has spread to humans turning them into &#39;the infected&rsquo;, frothing killers that attack in vicious bands. Balfron Tower offers the couple temporary salvation. They&nbsp;scale a barricade of upturned shopping trolleys - &ldquo;What is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys?&rdquo; Jim asks - and escape zombies on the stairwell, climbing all the way to reach a candlelit top-floor flat occupied by a father and his daughter, the iron-gated number 157.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Without running water, they visit the roof strewn with buckets and plastic sheeting to collect rainwater, but have to leave as the threat of attack grows by the day. &ldquo;Sound carries in this flat, you know, jerry-built I suppose.&rdquo;</em></p>
