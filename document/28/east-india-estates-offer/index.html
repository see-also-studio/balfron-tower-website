          <p><strong>p.23&nbsp;3.4.4 Balfron Tower and Carradale House&nbsp;</strong><br />
The Council and Poplar HARCA have been considering the best long-term solution for these blocks and following discussions with residents of both blocks it has been agreed that a scheme of major refurbishment would proceed over the next 5 years if the blocks transfer to Poplar HARCA. Due to their &ldquo;listed&rdquo; status, the cost of the work is significantly higher than other, more typical, Council homes in the area. This because there are special rules and regulations that must be complied with when refurbishment work is carried out to listed buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.24-6 3.4.5 New homes on Brownfield and the &ldquo;choices&rdquo; option&nbsp;</strong><br />
In addition to the major refurbishment of both Balfron Tower and Carradale House, Poplar HARCA also proposes to build 130 new homes on the Brownfield Estate in the locations shown on the plans in this document. These new homes will be a mixture of family houses, flats and maisonettes which will be either for rent or for sale. These new homes will be offered as a priority for residents in Balfron Tower and Carradale House to move into if they choose to do so. Where this option is taken up, the properties vacated in Balfron Tower and Carradale House will be sold as a means of providing additional funding towards the regeneration of the Estate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents of both blocks will be given a choice as to whether they wish to remain in their current home whilst the repairs and improvement work is carried out or move to one of these new homes being built on the Estate. This choice will be available both to tenants and resident leaseholders in both blocks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the new homes proposed will need to be built first to enable those who choose to do so to move into them before the refurbishment works to Balfron Tower and Carradale House begin. The new homes will only be built and the offer to move into them given if planning permission and other consents required are granted. Poplar HARCA plans to make these applications as soon as possible. There will also need to be a great deal more consultation with local residents on the plans over the coming months. The proposals for Balfron Tower and Carradale House are therefore subject to Poplar HARCA obtaining full detailed planning permission for the new homes. Informal discussions with the Council over these proposals have already taken place and there is an &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; agreement to the scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it is not currently anticipated, should more than 130 tenant and resident households wish to move from Balfron Tower and Carradale House, Poplar HARCA will aim to provide additional new homes within the Poplar area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after the ballot, if there is a &lsquo;yes vote&rsquo; in favour of transfer, Poplar HARCA will visit each resident in Balfron Tower and Carradale House to establish what their preference would be for their home in the future. At this stage individual preferences and needs will be established so that the new homes can be planned and built to meet the needs of those tenants and leaseholders who have stated a preference to move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The key benefits to residents of Balfron Tower and Carradale House from the proposals in this document would be as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>All tenants in the two blocks would have a new kitchen and bathroom installed either in the new home to be built on the Estate or in Balfron Tower or Carradale House depending on their choice</li>
	<li>New double glazed windows would be installed to every home where this has not already been done by the Council</li>
	<li>All outstanding repairs would be undertaken</li>
	<li>A programme of major improvements around both blocks would be undertaken enhancing the communal space outside the blocks</li>
	<li>Improved security would be provided to the blocks and the Estate environment</li>
	<li>The environment would be improved generally</li>
	<li>Existing open space would be improved and some new open space provided</li>
	<li>Much more suitable new homes would be built for those who consider that their lives would be improved by a move out of Balfron Tower and Carradale House. These new homes would be designed with regard to disabled access and use in line with current building regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.5 Proposals for moving home &ndash; Residents who choose to move from Balfron Tower and Carradale House only&nbsp;</strong><br />
If the transfer goes ahead, and subject to the usual consents being obtained to build new homes, e.g. planning permission, residents living in Balfron Tower and Carradale House will be given a choice to stay in their existing home or move to a new home to be built on the Brownfield Estate. This is outlined above as the &lsquo;Choices Scheme&rsquo;. The new accommodation will be built to suit the needs of those choosing to move and therefore, if the transfer goes ahead, every family wishing to move will have an individual discussion about their specific needs with a housing officer. This proposal is being made because Poplar HARCA and residents consulted during the last two years or so feel that the accommodation in these blocks is not suitable for a number of households.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This section explains how the process will happen as currently envisaged and subject to further consultation with residents on individual preferences:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Homes to suit your needs&nbsp;</strong><br />
Residents who choose to move home will be allocated to properties which are the appropriate size for their household. If you currently live in a home that is larger than you need you will be given the option of moving to a smaller property and will be entitled to a cash incentive for each bedroom lost. This will be &pound;500 per bedroom given up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secure tenants who choose to be moved will be asked to identify their preferred new home from those available. The only exceptions to this will be if there is only one property of the necessary size available and no choice is possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where two or more households, needing the same size of accommodation, ask for the same property, priority will be given to those tenants with severe medical reasons, or who are severely overcrowded and then to those with the earliest registration date on the Common Housing Register.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the transfer goes ahead, Poplar HARCA proposes to build 130 new homes on the Brownfield Estate which will accommodate just over half of the current population of the two blocks. This number of new homes has been proposed for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Consultation undertaken has shown that approximately half of the residents in the two blocks said that they would prefer to move out and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This number of new homes has been agreed in principle as a reasonable number for the Estate in planning terms.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, should more than 130 residents express a wish to move, then Poplar HARCA will attempt to accommodate them either in its existing stock on other Estates in Poplar or in new homes being built on other Estates in the area. Should this be the case then all applicants to move will be asked their preference for staying in the immediate area (Brownfield Estate) or moving elsewhere in Poplar.</p>

<p>The lettings policy for the new homes. As mentioned above, it is anticipated that new homes on the Estate will be available for all residents in the two blocks that request them and that a prioritisation process will not be required. In the unlikely event that a prioritisation process is required this will be agreed following consultation and full discussion with your resident representatives.</p>

<p>When would I be able to move if I choose to do so? Poplar HARCA intends that, assuming the transfer happens in April 2007, that the new homes could be available from 2009.</p>
