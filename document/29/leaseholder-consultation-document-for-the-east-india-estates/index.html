          <p><strong>p.17&nbsp;2.4.4 Balfron Tower and Carradale House&nbsp;</strong><br />
The key benefits to residents of Balfron Tower and Carradale House from the proposals in this document would be as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>􏰃All residents in the two blocks will get a choice of moving home or remaining in the block as set out below&nbsp;</li>
	<li>New double glazed windows would be installed to every home where this has not already been done by the Council&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All outstanding communal repairs would be undertaken&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A programme of major improvements around both blocks would be undertaken enhancing the communal space outside the blocks&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Improved security would be provided to the blocks and the estate environment&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The environment would be improved generally</li>
	<li>Existing open space would be improved and some new open space provided&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.4.5 New Homes on Brownfield and the &ldquo;Choices&rdquo; option&nbsp;</strong><br />
In addition to the major refurbishment of both Balfron Tower and Carradale House, Poplar HARCA also proposes to build 130 new homes on the Brownfield Estate. These new homes will be a mixture of family houses, flats and maisonettes which will be either for rent or for sale. These new homes will be offered as a priority for residents in Balfron Tower and Carradale House to move into if they choose to do so. Where this option is taken up, the properties vacated in Balfron Tower and Carradale House will be sold as a means of providing additional funding towards the regeneration of the Estate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents of both blocks will be given a choice as to whether they wish to remain in their current home whilst the repairs and improvement work is carried out or move to one of these new homes being built on the Estate. This choice will be available both to tenants and resident leaseholders in both blocks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the new homes proposed will need to be built first to enable those who choose to do so to move into them before the refurbishment works to Balfron Tower and Carradale House begin. The new homes will only be built and the offer to move into them given if planning permission and other consents required are granted. Poplar HARCA plans to make these applications as soon as possible. There will also need to be a great deal more consultation with local residents on the plans over the coming months. The proposals for Balfron Tower and Carradale House are therefore subject to Poplar HARCA obtaining full detailed planning permission for the new homes. Informal discussions with the Council over these proposals have already taken place and there is an &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; agreement to the scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it is not currently anticipated, should more than 130 tenant and resident households wish to move from Balfron Tower and Carradale House, Poplar HARCA will aim to provide additional new homes within the Poplar area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after the ballot, if there is a &lsquo;yes vote&rsquo; in favour of transfer, Poplar HARCA will visit each resident in Balfron Tower and Carradale House to establish what their preference would be for their home in the future. At this stage individual preferences and needs will be established so that the new homes can be planned and built to meet the needs of those tenants and leaseholders who have stated a preference to move.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2.4.6 LEASEHOLDERS IN THESE TWO BLOCKS WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Poplar HARCA will buy your lease at market value. Market value will be agreed following advice from Chartered Valuers at the time of negotiation / sale.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You could transfer the equity in your current flat and buy into a new flat built by Poplar HARCA (you would need to finance any difference between the valuation of your existing lease and that of the new property) There will be an option for some of the equity to be deferred depending upon personal circumstances&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You could swap your existing lease for a Poplar HARCA property of the same size and valuation&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the ballot and providing that this is in favour of transfer, Poplar HARCA will enter into individual discussions with all leaseholders top determine personal preference and circumstances. Decisions on which option leaseholders would prefer to pursue will not need to be made until after transfer and work is due to commence on the refurbishment.of the blocks.</p>
