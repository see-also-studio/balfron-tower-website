          <p><strong>p.4&nbsp;Overview</strong><br />
The Balfron Tower Conservation Area was designated in October 1998 around the two residential blocks designed by Ern&ouml; Goldfinger for the London County Council in the 1960s. The Conservation Area boundary protects the listed Balfron Tower and Carradale House, and other buildings in the &lsquo;Brownfield Estate&rsquo;, including Glenkerry House, a community centre, shops and associated low-rise housing development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 27-storey Balfron Tower is Goldfinger&rsquo;s first public housing project, and a precursor to his better known Trellick Tower in North Kensington. The neighbouring Carradale House and Glenkerry House sit within the landscaped areas developed at the same time. The Brownfield Estate (also known as the East India Estate) is now recognised as a fine example of planned 1960s social housing. Considered to be exemplary examples of the post-war housing schemes, Balfron Tower and Carradale House were listed in 1998 for their cultural &amp; architectural merit.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.5&nbsp;Character</strong><br />
The Balfron Tower Conservation Area mainly consists of the low and high-rise council flats of the Brownfield Estate. It lies to the north-east of Lansbury, the Festival of Britain&rsquo;s Architectural Exhibition site, which was developed in 1951 following similar clearance. Balfron Tower dominates this landmark development and is representative of the post-war aspirations for good quality public housing. The tower is a significant realisation of many design concepts of the modern movement, expressing the social idealism of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.7&nbsp;Summary</strong><br />
This is an area of particular special architectural and historic interest, illustrated by its rich history and significant architecture, dating from the 20th century. The character and appearance of the area, as described in this appraisal, define its special qualities.</p>
