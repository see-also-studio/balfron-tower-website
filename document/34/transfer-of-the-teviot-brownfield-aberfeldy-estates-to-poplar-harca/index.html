          <p><strong>p.4&nbsp;6 OUTLINE OF THE REGENERATION PROPOSALS&nbsp;</strong><br />
6.1 &nbsp;The regeneration proposals across the three estates comprise a combination of comprehensive refurbishment and redevelopment with the construction of new homes. These proposals include the following:</p>

<p>6.2 &nbsp;Brownfield Estate: includes two grade II listed, high rise buildings, Balfron Tower and Carradale House. Due to their listed status and the scope of works required, these blocks will incur very high refurbishment costs.</p>

<p>6.3 &nbsp;As part of the regeneration proposals tenants and leaseholders of Balfron Tower and Carradale House will be offered the opportunity of moving out of these blocks into new homes, which Poplar HARCA proposes to build within the Brownfield Estate and immediate area. A total of 130 mixed tenure homes will include family houses, flats and maisonettes will be made available in the first instance to residents of Balfron Tower and Carradale House. The exact tenure mix of the new homes will depend upon how many Balfron and Carradale residents, both tenants and leaseholders take up the option to move. Where this option is taken up, the properties vacated in Balfron Tower and Carradale House will be refurbished and sold, to provide additional funding towards the cost of building the new homes and regeneration of the Estates. Overall there will be no loss of homes for rent on the Brownfield Estate.</p>
