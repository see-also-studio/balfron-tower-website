          <p><strong>p. 11 1.3.2.1 Historic and social value of urban concept&nbsp;</strong><br />
The estate is an example of large-scale urban design after World War II which demonstrated a departure from traditional ideas underpinning urban planning and concepts for social housing and proposed a new model for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although many of the concepts realised in the estate enjoyed a wider contemporary currency, it has particular value as a pioneering example of dense urban redevelopment, designed by one of the foremost modern architects of the period. It exhibits a discipline and refinement untypical of the genre and these values should be respected and protected, for their architectural quality, conviction and integrity.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.2.2 Holistic significance&nbsp;</strong><br />
The estate should be understood and appreciated in its entirety, not only as an aggregate of separate components. The residential, community, recreational, and commercial buildings and the external spaces between them form a whole architectural and social composition. The buildings are significant as a family group of sculptural forms. The views from and into the estate have become important, and part of interest lies in its distinctive identity and contrasting relationship to adjacent buildings, routes and the wider East End of London.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any developments on the immediate boundaries of the Conservation Area should take into account the significance of the estate&rsquo;s setting. No new buildings, infilling, removals or extensions should be introduced which would be detrimental to the integrity of the estate as an ensemble.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.13&nbsp;1.3.2.3 Diversity</strong><br />
The estate is significant in its attempt to create a viable and sustainable community within a tightly defined urban context. It provides not only a high density of accommodation but also large areas of open space and diverse social facilities and amenities.</p>

<p>From its earliest conception the estate was planned (and was built) to include facilities for residents, leisure facilities including ball courts, as well as a shop, stores, public toilets, a children&rsquo;s playground, residents&rsquo; activity rooms, garages and drying areas. Later, as part of Phase 3, there would be more shops, a launderette and the club/ community centre (which had dual use with the planned nursery), as well as more open spaces, a car park, private gardens and another club (containing an old peoples facility). Provision was made for different age groups (children, teenagers, old people) and facilities which would have sometimes dual use around the clock (e.g. nursery/ club, jazz &amp; pop room/ play room). It is important that this diversity is sustained.</p>

<p>Ideally any future regeneration programme would remedy inappropriate alterations and revitalise the neglected areas. Goldfinger archives at the RIBA collection offer a wealth of information in this regard allowing for an informed and authentic regeneration of original designs and design intentions.</p>

<p><strong>p.18&nbsp;1.3.2.8 Design of Communal Areas</strong><br />
Communal areas are enhanced by surfaces of tactile interest and special materials (very special for social housing) suggesting the value attached to spaces used by and &lsquo;belonging to&rsquo; everybody. These retain significance and should be maintained or reinstated wherever possible.</p>

<p><strong>p.24&nbsp;1.3.2.15 Facilities and amenities</strong><br />
The inclusion of social spaces and amenities for different age groups was central to the original concept of the estate and contributes to its special character. The use and social access for which each of the buildings was intended should be reviewed and ideally be respected. A change of ownership and/ or management of the estate might result in proposals for alternative uses for a particular amenity space/ structure; this only should be resisted if it would detract from the estate&rsquo;s special character.</p>

<p><strong>p.28&nbsp;1.3.2.24 Conservation Management&nbsp;</strong><br />
It is recommended that a specific management role is identified within Poplar HARCA (and any future managing agency) for the listed building assets at Brownfield, and that this role would include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Responsibility for ensuring a sustainable and viable future for the residents and the buildings</li>
	<li>Ownership of the Conservation Management Plan including its cyclical future reviews and application to support the regeneration and conservation of the asset</li>
	<li>Establishment of a supporting group including residents and appropriate representatives from the planning and conservation authorities to provide for meaningful ongoing consultation and advice on works to the buildings</li>
	<li>Exploration and promotion of opportunities for expanding and developing the proposals</li>
	<li>Promotion of wider understanding and appreciation of the heritage asset and the work of Erno Goldfinger within the estate and beyond</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>p.29&nbsp;1.3.2.27 Conservation strategies&nbsp;</strong><br />
While the best practice guidance should inform day-to-day management, several other initiatives may be appropriate for preserving the character and special interest of the estate, such as: the designation of heritage flats; systematic recording of changes to the estate; accessible archival sources; oral histories and site mapping.&nbsp;<br />
In the interests of sustainability and as acknowledged in the Conservation Area Management Guidelines, the most effective way to secure the historic environment is to ensure that the buildings contribute to the life of the community, preferably funding their own maintenance and refurbishment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.42&nbsp;2.5.1 Common Parts&nbsp;</strong><br />
All flats have painted wooden front doors with large square vision panels at the access level with spyholes, distinctive numbered letterboxes and to the initiated, they all appear to have equal status to each other in the design, as (excluding the maisonettes) do the fa&ccedil;ade elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.44&nbsp;2.5.2 Flat Types A, BU, BL, C, CU, CL, D &amp; E&nbsp;</strong><br />
All the flats are generously planned, in excess of the Parker Morris standards of the time24, with the bigger (of already large, south or west facing) balconies denoting the larger flats.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>p.66&nbsp;2.9 Landscape&nbsp;2.9.1 Description of original asset</strong><br />
It is evident from the archival sources and from the completed and surviving landscape that the original design placed great emphasis in accomplishing a connective and distinctive setting for the housing and other buildings.</p>
