          <p>We are appalled at the treatment of residents of Balfron Tower, who have been told by their social landlord, HARCA, that they must leave their homes for refurbishment of their kitchens and bathrooms, but will not be allowed to return. HARCA are more interested in raising money through the sale of Balfron Tower than in the residents. They took responsibility for the community in the Tower under the promise that they would improve the life of the residents by refurbishing their flats. Before the vote to go with HARCA a model flat was set-up showing residents what their homes would look like under HARCA. These improvements are to be done but not for the residents, but to make the flats more profitable whilst the community is forced to leave. We demand that the Balfron Tower residents are not forced to leave but have the choice to keep their homes.</p>
