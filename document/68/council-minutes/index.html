<u>6.2 Question from Miss Claire Drake:-</u><br />
Tenants and residents are delighted that the refurbishment works to bring Balfron Tower up to Decent Homes standards will start next year.</p>

<p>Poplar HARCA, our landlord, is verbally now refusing and not at all forthcoming with information on whether any tenants will be able to return to their homes when the works are completed. Balfron Tower was built in the late 1960s and originally all 146 homes were for rent to Council tenants. We are concerned that Poplar HARCA is planning to sell all the homes in this block on the open market rather than let them to social housing tenants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will the Council help secure the right of return for tenants to their homes in Balfron Tower on completion of the Decent Homes work?</p>

<p><u>Response by Councillor Rabina Khan, Cabinet Member for Housing:-</u><br />
Thank you Miss Drake for submitting this question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I understand your concerns and those of other residents in Balfron Tower about the lack of information and reassurances from Poplar HARCA about tenants&rsquo; right to return.</p>

<p>I can assure you that the Council are doing everything within our power to ensure that residents do have the right to return if they wish to exercise it.<br />
During the Housing Choice consultation, many residents asked whether they would retain the same rights as Council tenants if they voted for the transfer and became tenants of an RSL.</p>

<p>The answer given by Poplar HARCA in their offer document was that with a couple of exceptions, &ldquo;your rights with an RSL would be the same as with the Council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crucially the offer document clearly mentions &ldquo;The Right to be given information about the management of your home&rdquo;, so this should encourage Poplar HARCA to answer queries about whether tenants can return to Balfron Tower after refurbishment.</p>

<p>The document from Poplar HARCA titled &ldquo;Information for Residents living in Balfron and Carradale Towers&rdquo; specifically spates: &ldquo;If you have lived in your home for at least the last 12 months as your only or principal home then you will be entitled to a home loss payment when you move. This is currently &pound;4,700. Only one payment is made per household. If you want to return to your home when the works are done then you will not be entitled to this payment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This document seems to indicate that residents are indeed entitled to return; under the circumstances indicated above.</p>

<p>However we need greater clarity on this and I am organising a meeting between tenants and Poplar HARCA to try to get that clarity.</p>

<p><u>Summary of supplementary question from Miss Claire Drake:-</u><br />
Does Poplar HARCA have planning permission or listed building consent to carry out the proposed works to Balfron Tower?</p>

<p><u>Summary of Councillor Rabina Khan&rsquo;s response:-</u><br />
I have submitted a Member&rsquo;s Enquiry on this matter and I will have the information available for the meeting.</p>
