          <p><em>The choice of Macbeth is interesting (and considering Balfron is in the borough of Tower Hamlets I think they missed a trick), but I would like to draw attention to articles in national and arts press. One of RIFT&rsquo;s founders, explains how he was approached by the owners and asked whether he would like use the tower. He said he was interested in how Balfron&rsquo;s utopian vision of the future, in his words, &quot;became a vision of dystopia instead &ndash; in this, I see a similarity to Macbeth himself: the architect wants to be king to make things better and he just ends up making things worse.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The Guardian wrote &quot;at least temporarily, the decaying flats and empty walkways of the high-rise block, will be brought back to life as the stage.&quot;&nbsp;But&nbsp;the flats and walkways were not empty as a few residents explain in the comments sections below-the-line. Some short-term&nbsp;residents were moved on from the upper floors by the housing association to make way for it and other long-term residents were still living there.</em></p>
