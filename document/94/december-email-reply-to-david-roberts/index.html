          <p><em>1. Can you update me on the decision whether social rented tenants will have a right of return to Balfron Tower?&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>There is still no final decision on this. The expectation remains that it is possible but not probable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>2. What proportion of additional residential dwellings built as part of the regeneration works on the Brownfield Estate are designated social rent?</em></p>

<p>Sorry, thought I&#39;d sent these... Linked with Poplar HARCA - Infill blocks (currently being completed) will provide 25 homes (accom for 97 people) for social rent; new build in Ida &amp; Follett Street has provided 32 new family sized houses and flats (3-7 bed) all for social rent; Panoramic building provided 112 homes, 90 for private sale and 22 family sized for shared ownership. There have been other new builds locally, not connected with us - I&#39;m unaware of their tenure. I&#39;m not sure if your research is interested in size of homes, but have included them above as this is a constant focus for our residents that I expect you have encountered.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>3. Will there be a net gain or loss of social rented accommodation within the Brownfield Estate following regeneration works?&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>See above - we&#39;ve increased the number of social rented homes in Brownfield and across Poplar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>4. How do you define a mixed community? How do you measure whether your aspirations of building a mixed community on the Brownfield Estate have been met?</em></p>

<p>Regular resident surveys, focusing on satisfaction across a range of themes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>5. Can you describe your cultural programming on the Brownfield Estate? How do you evaluate the impact of this?</em></p>

<p>There is a broad range of cultural activity throughout the Poplar area, aimed at the broadest range of residents. From community fairs, to art installations, from youth arts opportunities to special interest activities to on-site theatre. Brownfield is fortunate to include the Spotlight Youth facility, the Burcham Street Centre, and the Community Cabin, - Poplar HARCA facilities which each offer a large range of popular content. Brownfield also hosted the eclectic mix of activity that formed the recent Balfron Season.</p>

<p>We assess the content of that considerable activity through ongoing interviews with Brownfield residents, local residents, local groups and enterprises, as well as those outside he area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final decision has not yet been made regarding final tenure mix at Balfron Tower</p>

<p><em>2 a) Do social rented tenants of Balfron Tower have a right to return?</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
This will be discussed with our joint venture partners. Is possible, but not probable, that some may return</p>
