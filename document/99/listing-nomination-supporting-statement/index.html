          <p>Goldfinger&rsquo;s structures on the Brownfield Estate are designed with an attention to detail and quality of materials unusual for the 60s or any other decade. The low-rise stockbrick blocks form a series of streets around three larger-scale structures; the tower, with its proudly modelled lift tower serving the function once taken up by church and town hall spires; Carradale House, its long walkways connecting cubic mid-rise blocks; and Glenkerry House, perhaps weirdest of all, a tall block culminating in another curved service-tower-cum-spire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Brownfield Estate as a whole is still remarkable as an example of a time when public housing could be valued as much, or rather more, than any other form of building &ndash; as landmarks that were meant to be seen at a distance, declaring the local council&#39;s pride at housing its inhabitants. These pieces of inner city architectural sculpture are fragments of a better, more egalitarian and more fearless kind of city than the ones we actually live in.</p>

<p>The ﬂats are large and simple, the bared concrete is beautiful, detailed with a craftsman&rsquo;s obsessiveness, the communal areas largely make sense, and the buildings have an impressive sense of order and controlled drama.</p>

<p>The listing of buildings should always be careful not to be just a matter of listing a few lone &#39;icons&#39; to be preserved as toys, and be careful not to list buildings as shells that can be filled with anything, particularly when their purpose is still very much needed. On this basis I support the listing of the Brownfield Estate as a whole as a coherent, well made and complete example of public housing well above the current standard of private housing - and which must stay as public housing, in an area that desperately needs it. On both architectural and social grounds, this is a place which needs preserving.</p>
